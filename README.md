Unfortunately, most of my coding is/was done professionally in proprietary repositories. Expect most repos here to be just be a bunch of simple stuff, like scripts, small tools/try-outs, and maybe here and there a bigger project ;)

Currently working on genetic algorithms 🧬 that produce novel kinds of neural networks 🧠... so stay tuned 📺!
